### [Meet the Team](website/AboutTeam.md)

### Problem Statement: 

Making “gains” in the gym is hard, especially when working out alone. Through loud music and intense exercises, we want to optimize workouts by tracking the quantity and quality of repetitions.

### Solution:
We are developing a cheap wearable device that tracks repetitions.
